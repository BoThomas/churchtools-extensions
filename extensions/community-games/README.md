# Community Games

Play interactive team-based games with your church community directly in ChurchTools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Extension Key:** `communitygames` — You'll need this key when installing the extension in ChurchTools.

## What is it?

Community Games brings casual gaming to your church community. Create game sessions where church members can join teams and play classic games together – perfect for youth groups, community events, or just some friendly competition!

## Games Available

### 🎮 TicTacToe (Team vs Team)

The classic 3x3 grid game where teams take turns placing X's and O's. First team to get three in a row wins!

### 🔴 Connect Four (Team vs Team)

Drop colored discs into a vertical grid. First team to connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

### Extensible

The extension is designed to allow adding more games in the future. Developers can create new game modules that integrate seamlessly with the existing team voting and game management system.
